# Welcome to our project!

## How we got started:

We noticed that social media and social justice have been intersecting more and more,
especially with shareable resources and places to get involved. In addition, it's becoming more
and more common that content creators are putting charities and causes they support in bios or even
featuring them on streams.

As a result we wanted to create something that would allow frequent, easy, shareable acces to a list of causes
and resources that while simultaneously allowing a person to create a snapshot of their own personal affiliations, beliefs, and 
issues that they care individually about.

## How Does it work?

The user goes onto a list creator and inputs the links to resources they want to be present when someone scans
their QR code. Then they review their final list and generate a QR code if it looks good! They then can share this QR code
to whatever social media allows for picture uploads. It then can be scanned and reshared by anyone who sees it!

## What are the goals?

We want to make getting involved as easy as possible and scanning a QR code that automatically gives you a list of resources
allows people who identify with the causes of an individual to get more involved and knowledgeable. 

## Flexibility

We take pride in the flexibility of this program and hope that not only can it be used for sharing causes and movements 
but also to organize people and events beyond just social justice. The QR code could contain information about an event or
even just a list of readings or resources on a cool topic or idea. Shareability is endlessly applicable.
